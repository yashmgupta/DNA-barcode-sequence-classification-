# DNA-barcode-sequence-classification-
Herein, we present a quantum-inspired tensor network-based machine learning model to categorizes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI).

We created and tested the quantum-inspired tensor network-based classifier for an alignment-free classification. The model takes the k-mer as features and map each k-mer in a high dimensional feature space. The tensor network model is shown to classify COI DNA barcode fragments at the order level with an overall accuracy greater than 99 %. 

We have provided a sample training and testing dataset, as well as a jupyter notebook, to allow you to test the model.
